Why would you want to mod a Xbox 360 in 2019?

- Run homebrew applications. (Dashlaunch, Aurora, XM360, etc.)
- Backup your games to your HDD.
- Get more life out of your old system.
- Learning how to mod can be fun!

Growing up I was always tinkering with things whether it was taking apart old PC power supplies or flashing new roms on my LG G2. I always knew about soft mods such as modifying account gamer scores or modding solo campaign missions but hardware modifications was more intriguing to me. I first started to get excited about console modding back during the early Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 days. After spending countless hours trying to get into a modded lobby on the MP map rust I finally did it. Ever since then I knew i wanted to get my own modded console. Well 6 years later and finishing up my bachelors degree It was time.

Here is a video time laps of me installing a mod chip in a Xbox 360 Elite.
